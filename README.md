## Finding all the anagrams of a sentence using the Scala Collections API

This is implemenetd in Anagrams.scala

An anagram of a word is a rearrangement of its letters such that a word with a different meaning is formed. For example, if we rearrange the letters of the word `Elvis` we can obtain the word `lives`, which is one of its anagrams.

In a similar way, an anagram of a sentence is a rearrangement of all the characters in the sentence such that a new sentence is formed. The new sentence consists of meaningful words, the number of which may or may not correspond to the number of words in the original sentence. For example, the sentence:

###### I love you

is an anagram of the sentence:

###### You olive
